     	      <h1> Qualcomm Implements New Corporate Structure </h1>
     	     <p>
             SAN DIEGO – October 01, 2012 – Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM), a leading developer and innovator of advanced wireless technologies, products and services, today completed the Company’s previously announced plans to modify its corporate structure. As previously stated, the corporate structure changes have been implemented, among other reasons, in order to enhance Qualcomm’s ability to quickly deliver products to its customers, while further protecting and insulating its valuable patent portfolio from any claims resulting from actions and activities by portions of the company other than the Qualcomm Technology Licensing Division (QTL). Qualcomm did not undergo this restructuring in anticipation, or as part, of spinning out either the QTL or QCT businesses, nor was this change in response to any third party actions or claims.

The new corporate structure features the parent company, Qualcomm Incorporated, which includes QTL and corporate functions, as well as most of Qualcomm’s patent portfolio, and a wholly owned subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), which, along with its subsidiaries, now operates substantially all of Qualcomm’s research and development activities, as well as product and services businesses, including its semiconductor business, QCT.

Under the new structure, QTI and its subsidiaries owns patents specifically developed for purposes of providing open source software contributions by QTI and its subsidiaries, whereas substantially all of the remainder of the company’s patent portfolio is owned by Qualcomm Incorporated. QTI and its subsidiaries have no rights to grant licenses or other rights to patents held by Qualcomm Incorporated. There are no changes to the intellectual property that is currently owned by Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc., which works closely with the open source community to accelerate the advancement of the wireless industry as a whole.

“As a market leader in mobile communications technology, Qualcomm has always been, and will continue to be, responsive to changes in market demand,” said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, chairman and CEO. “I am pleased by the seamless transition of our corporate structure for our employees and customers and look forward to the accelerated innovation and quicker delivery of our products and services to market and the increased protection of our industry-leading patent portfolio. As always, Qualcomm’s unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of mobile through breaking down barriers to reach more, connect more and create more experiences remains strong.”

Qualcomm does not expect any change to the way in which it defines its operating segments for financial reporting purposes as a result of this restructuring.

     	     <h1>Qualcomm announces new Snapdragon S4 Play MSM8x25Q processors with quad-core CPUs and reference design counterpart for high-volume smartphones</h1>
     	      <p>
               BEIJING – September 27, 2012 – Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today announced the addition of two new Snapdragon™ S4 mobile processors: the MSM8225Q and MSM8625Q. Both are members of the Snapdragon S4 Play processor tier, optimised specifically for a broad range of smartphone users seeking faster applications and better user experiences. Snapdragon S4 Play processors will now offer OEMs both dual-core and quad-core CPUs and performance for entry-level smartphones, with the more advanced version featuring higher bus bandwidth, larger screen resolution support, HD video and enhanced user experiences. Both processors will be ready for customer sampling by end of 2012 and are expected to be shipping in commercial devices in the first quarter of 2013.

The MSM8225Q and MSM8625Q processors incorporate quad-core CPUs and are the upgraded software compatible variants of the highly successful Snapdragon S4 Play MSM8225 and MSM8625 processors, which both feature dual-core CPUs and dual SIM support. The quad-core variants will support LPDDR2 memory, increasing the bus bandwidth for improved features such as 720p display and 720p video encode and decode. Snapdragon S4 Play MSM8625Q features Qualcomm’s integrated multimode UMTS/CDMA modem, and the MSM8225Q has an integrated UMTS modem. Both processors enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and FM connectivity using the Qualcomm Atheros AR6005 and WCN2243 chips.

In addition, Qualcomm also announced a single platform, the Snapdragon S4 Plus MSM8930, which supports all China operators with UMTS, CDMA and TD-SCDMA. Furthermore, this single platform will support LTE-TDD and TD-SCDMA, targeting mid-tier smartphones for use in China. Announced in February 2011, this processor features dual-core CPUs and as the world’s first single-chip solution with an integrated LTE modem, it is designed to take LTE to high-volume smartphones. Snapdragon S4 Plus MSM8930 with LTE-TDD and TD-SCDMA support will be ready for customer sampling by the end of 2012 and is expected to be shipping in commercial devices by the first quarter of 2013.

Qualcomm will also be releasing Qualcomm Reference Design (QRD) versions of all three processors. The QRD program includes comprehensive handset development platforms and an ecosystem program providing access to third-party providers of tested and verified hardware and software components so customers can rapidly deliver differentiated smartphones to budget conscious consumers. The Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and FM connectivity technologies have been pre-validated and tested with the QRD platform to provide reduced time-to-market. There have been more than 50 public QRD-based product launches to date in collaboration with more than 40 OEMs, and there are 100 designs in progress, including QRD-based smartphones enabled by these new Snapdragon S4 Play and Plus processors, which are also expected to be available by the first quarter of 2013.

“Our broad portfolio of Snapdragon S4 mobile processors delivers the optimal balance of features and performance for the high-volume smartphone segment,” said Cristiano Amon, senior vice president and co-president of mobile and computing products. “By offering both dual-core and quad-core CPU versions of the Snapdragon S4 Play processor, we are providing our OEM and operating partners a competitive and differentiated platform.”

The new Snapdragon S4 Play and Plus processors are designed specifically for high-volume smartphones, and they provide device manufacturers the ability to migrate their existing Snapdragon S1-based designs to S4 dual- and quad-core CPU-based designs. This capability is particularly useful for device manufacturers looking to efficiently expand their smartphone product lines with more advanced 3G/LTE smartphone products.
